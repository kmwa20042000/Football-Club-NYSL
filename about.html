            <p class="indent">The Northside Youth Soccer League was established in 1996 to provide athletes residing in Chicago's
                northside neighborhood an environment to learn and play soccer. To be a member of NYSL, you must be
                between the ages of 4-12 and reside in a Chicago northside neighborhood. NYSL is run by a small,
                full-time staff, and relies on the generous volunteer time of parents and former league members.
